Traditionally, origami patterns are designed in one sheet
of paper by simply adding mountain and valley creases,
and it usually results in the design in Fig. 4(a), here we

This reverse extending strategy could apply to Miura-

parallel-motion origami structure with 4 Miura-ori cells
is shown, which we call it second-order parallel-motion

Unlike the single-unit Miura-ori structure, which has
only one possibility for parallel-motion, there could be
different choices for multiple Miura-ori structures when
we want to get parallel-motion tips. Fig. 4(d)(e)(f)
showed three different ways to get those parallel-motion
facets.

on thick origami structure hinge design [19], [20]. In

same plane when input angle is zero, while in thick
Miura origami structure, the four hinges will locate on
two parallel planes and construct a spatial 4R linkage
also known as Bennett linkage [21]. The thick origami

After we get the unit thick Miura-ori structure, we
can apply it to parallel-motion design. As shown in Fig.
5(a), the simplest parallel-motion structure is composed
of one dual-layer tip and one thick Miura-ori cell (Fig.
