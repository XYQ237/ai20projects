more  recent  work  used  nonholonomic  motion  planning, 
typically used for car models, to plan the steering of flexible 
needles [14]. This work suggests that by using nonholonomic 
modeling, control and path planning, a bevel-tip needle can 
reach a target location in a 3D environment. Unlike previous 
work, our proposed mechanism uses the bevel-tip steering 
concept inside a soil-like granular medium rather than in a 
tissue-like homogeneous ballistic gel. The concept of our 
underground  robot  is  a  stiff  and  short  mechanism,  fully 
submerged inside granular medium surface as opposed to the 
long and flexible needle used in the medical applications that 
extends above the surface.

T10S motion tracking system was used to record the robot’s 
trajectory and measure its radius of curvature. To identify the 
robot’s pose in space, we placed reflective markers on the 
robot that allow a 2 mm measurement accuracy. Since the 
robot is mostly underground, we connected the markers to 
beams protruding outside and visible to the cameras. We 
conducted an additional experiment to show the change in 
direction of the robot, on which we accurately measured the 
robot’s displacement using BAUMER ODAM12 laser sensor, 
with resolution of 2-5 μm and National Instruments signal 
acquiring system, at 1,000 Hz. 
Throughout  the  experiments,  we  discovered  that  the 
steering angle of the robot is affected not only by the bevel-tip 
but also by the length of the robot. This is logical since a longer 
robot may present a longer distance between the equivalent 
reaction forces that oppose the moment (shown above in Fig.

work done thus far focused either on robots that are rigidly 
connected above surface and can perform limited trajectories, 
or untethered robots that can solely move straight. There has 
been little research reported on non-rigidly attached robots that 
are also able to maneuver underground. The purpose of this 
study is to design a robot that can do both. In this paper, a 
simple  mechanical  design  is  presented,  that  achieves  net 
motion with an internal mechanism propelling itself and a 
bevel-tip head that steers toward the desired direction. A 
simplified dynamic model of the thrusting mechanism and 
kinematic model of the bicycle model was introduced and was 
used to perform numerical simulations. Using the simulations,
