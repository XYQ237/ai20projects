Distributed Rotor-Based Vibration Suppression for Flexible Object
Transport and Manipulation
Hyunsoo Yang1, Min-Seong Kim1, and Dongjun Lee1
Abstract—The RVM (Robot-based Vibration Suppression
Modules) is proposed for the manipulation and transport
of a large ﬂexible object. Since the RVM is easily attach-
able/detachable to the object, this RVM allows distributing
over the manipulated object so that it is scalable to the object
size. The composition of the system is partly motivated by the
MAGMaS (Multiple Aerial-Ground Manipulator System) [1]–
[3], however, since the quadrotor usage is mechanically too
complicated and its design is not optimized for manipulation,
thus we overcome these limitations using distributed RVMs
and newly developed theory. For this, we ﬁrst provide a
