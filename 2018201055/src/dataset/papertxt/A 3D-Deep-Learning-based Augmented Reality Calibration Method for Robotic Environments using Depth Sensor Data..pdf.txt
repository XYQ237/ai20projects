Internally-Balanced Magnetic Mechanisms Using a Magnetic Spring 
for Producing a Large Amplified Clamping Force

  Abstract—To detach a permanent magnet using a control 
force  much  smaller  than  its  original  attractive  force,  the 
internally-balanced magnetic unit (IB Magnet) was invented. It 
has been applied to magnetic devices such as wall-climbing 
robots, ceiling-dangling drones, and modular swarm robots. In 
contrast to its significant reduction rate with regard to the 
control force, the IB Magnet has two major problems in its 
nonlinear spring, which serves the purpose of cancelling out the 
internal  force  on  the  magnet.  These  problems  include  the 
complicated design procedure and the trade-off relationship 
between  balancing  the  precision  and  the  volume  of  the 
mechanism. This paper proposes a principle for a new balancing 
method for the IB Magnet. This method uses a like-pole pair of 
magnets as a magnetic spring, whose repulsive force should 
equal the attractive force of an unlike-pole pair. To verify the 
proposed principle, a prototype of the IB Magnet was designed 
using a magnetic spring and verified through experiments such 
that its reduction rate is comparable to those of conventional IB   
Magnets.  Moreover,  a  robotic  clamp  was  developed  as  an  Figure 1.  Proof-of-concept model of the proposed Internally-Balanced

operations should switch the reduction state by one degree of 
freedom. This can be a high-speed state until the finger 
touches the object to complete the clamping quickly and a 
high-torque state after the finger touches the object to sustain 
the  clamping  position  firmly.  Conventionally,  this  state 
transition has been achieved by using sensors that provide 
information regarding the existence of the clamping object 
between the fingers and the regulating current for the actuator 
driving an active finger. This electronic method, however, 
requires  a  certain  processing  load  and  a  variable  power 
consumption of the robotic system.  
To  reduce  the  complexity of  the  control,  spontaneous 
reduction mechanisms have been proposed that can be driven 
passively by a linear actuator, such as a screw with a nut, with 
a constant extra load (ideally as small as possible) at any 
displacement of the finger caused by the addition of the 
reduction mechanism [16-18]. As featured in Fig. 8 (a), such 
mechanisms use mechanical joints, like toggle and clutch, to 
restrict the further movement of the actuator position by 
placing them to the dead center when the finger touches the 
object. The detection of the load or displacement triggers the 
switch of reduction state of the actuator. However, they used 
to be not capable of adjusting the clamping force because   
these switching mechanisms allow only a binary state of
