The rigidity of the structure will be greater if the 1st mode is 
higher. The constraint function imposes a minimum frequency 
greater than 10 Hz. 
 
The second step increases the rigidity in the printing space

from 0.3 N.m/deg to 4.9 N.m/deg between the initial design 
and the second optimized design. Table 2 summarizes stiffness 
optimization results. 
B.  Modal analysis 
  For vibration modes, we note that the 6 modal frequencies 
have been increased. The first modal frequency increased 
from 5.86 Hz to 14.29 Hz with the first optimization and to 
19.31 Hz with the second optimization. The average of the 
first modal frequency overall the printing space is 30.05 Hz 
after optimization. The first mode is the most important in the 
center of the printing area as well as the second mode which 
 
are similar. The distribution of the modes is different between 
the initial and the optimal design. The mobile platform has 
been more rigidified in the central printing area. Table 3 
summarizes of the optimization results on modal frequencies.

The optimization of the anchors points contributes greatly 
to improve the accuracy of the CDPR in toolpath following. 
The volume of the printing space has been slightly increased. 
The choice of a fully constrained parallel cable robot solution 
greatly improves rigidity at the border of printing space.
