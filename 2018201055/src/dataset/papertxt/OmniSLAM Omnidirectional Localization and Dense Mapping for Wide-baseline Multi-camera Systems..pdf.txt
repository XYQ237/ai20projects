Abstract—Texture sensing is one of the types of information
sensed by humans through touch, and is thus of interest to
robotics that this type of information can be acquired and
processed.Inthisworkwepresentatexturetopographysensor

many organisms. The device consists of up to 9 elastic cilia
with permanent magnetization assembled on top of a highly
sensitive tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) sensor, within a
compact footprint of 6x6 mm2. When these cilia brush against
