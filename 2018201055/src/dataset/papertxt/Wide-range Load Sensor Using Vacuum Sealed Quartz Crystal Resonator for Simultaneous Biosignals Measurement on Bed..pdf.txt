B.  Stiffness Control Structure 
The proposed stiffness concept is composed of modular 
rigid links and soft pressure chambers which are made of UV 
curable  plastic  and  DragonSkin  10,  respectively.  By  the 
integration of two rigid links using alignment pins, a rigid 
compartment in a revolute joint form appears, then a pressure 
chamber  is  positioned  in  it  (Fig.  3a).  Lateral  and  axial 
expansions of the pressurized chamber are constrained by the 
rigid  compartment.  Upon pressurization,  the  stress  at  the 
contact surface between the pressure chamber and the rigid 
compartment increases. This causes increasing friction at the 
surface and resultant stiffness of the joint (Fig. 3b). As a   
result, the stiffness can be easily controlled by the input

To fabricate pressure chambers for the SCS, the prepared 
DragonSkin 10 was poured into the pressure chamber molds 
and a straight mold was placed at the middle for the inflation 
channel (Fig. 5e). Two alignment pins and a pressure pipe 
were glued to the cured chamber by silicone glue (Fig. 5f).

allows  controlling  the  stiffness  of  the  manipulator  by 
increasing the pressure. The SCS increases the manipulator 
stiffness from 156 to 211 Nmm/rad (increased by 35%), from 
156 to 203 Nmm/rad (increased by 30%) and from 151 to 
178  Nmm/rad  (increased  by  18%),  if  the  FRA  (r )  is

V.  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
In  this  study,  we  presented  a  variable  stiffness 
manipulator to address the predictability and controllability 
challenges of soft robotics. The manipulator consists of two 
fiber-reinforced  actuators  (FRAs)  and  hybrid  soft-rigid 
stiffness control structure (SCS), all of them controlled by 
simple  air  pressure.  The  FRAs  are  mainly  used  for 
positioning,  but  their  stiffness  depends  on  its  position. 
 
Meanwhile, the SCS is used to tune the stiffness of the 
manipulator without position dependency.
