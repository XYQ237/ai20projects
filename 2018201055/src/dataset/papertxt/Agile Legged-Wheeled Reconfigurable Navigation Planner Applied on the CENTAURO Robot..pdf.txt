   Abstract—  Accurate  force  sensing  is  important  for 
endoluminal intervention in terms of both safety and lesion 
targeting. This paper develops an FBG-based force sensor for 
robotic bronchoscopy by configuring three FBG sensors at the 
lateral side of a conical substrate. It allows a large and eccentric 
inner  lumen  for  the  interventional  instrument,  enabling  a 
flexible imaging probe inside to perform optical biopsy. The 
force sensor is embodied with a laser-profiled continuum robot 
and thermo drift is fully compensated by three temperature 
sensors integrated on the circumference surface of the sensor 
substrate. Different decoupling approaches are investigated, and 
nonlinear decoupling is adopted based on the cross-validation 
SVM and a Gaussian kernel function, achieving an accuracy of 
10.58 mN, 14.57 mN and 26.32 mN along X, Y and Z axis,   
respectively.  The  tissue  test  is  also  investigated  to  further

V.  DISCUSSION 
We have developed a triaxial force sensor for the optical 
biopsy. The calibration models using different approaches 
have been successfully derived and validated by residual error 
analysis. The accuracy along each axis has met our design 
requirements, of which the accuracy along the Z axis is worse, 
attributed to the substrate structure. This is also indicated by 
the  resolution  analysis  in  linear  calibration,  and  may  be 
addressed by local structure optimization of substrate [16]. 
It is also observed that the introduction of nonlinearities 
improves the sensor’s performance remarkably. In TABLE III, 
the residual errors based on each model is analysed. It is found 
that increasing terms in the equations improves the accuracy 
and  reduces  the  standard  deviation  of  residual  errors 
significantly, consistent with the theoretical calculation and 
analysis. The R-squared values of each regression model are 
determined to check the fitting condition and it is noticed that 
among these derived models, the model containing more terms 
have  higher  R-squared  value,  which  means  that  higher 
nonlinearity results in higher fitting goodness thus model’s 
interpretability. Within each model, the equation about the Z 
axis has lower R-square values and it demonstrates that the 
regression of Z-axial force components is the most difficult. 
From  TABLE  IV,  it  is  noticed  that  compared  to  linear 
 
calibration, the trained models using the SVM algorithm

residual errors in X, Y and Z axis respectively. 
Moreover, when associated with force components along the 
X and Y axes, its performance is similar to the model derived 
by quadratic adjusting whilst the performance along the Z axis 
is optimized remarkably.  
VI.  CONCLUSION 
A triaxial force sensor has been successfully developed b𝑁y 
using a tapered substrate with an eccentric inner lumen to hold 
the imaging probe inside and sensing elements outside, as well 
as maintaining the compatibility with the continuum robot. It 
enables the triaxial force measurement within a range of 0.5   
along each axis, which has met our design specifications. 
Different decoupling approaches including linear, nonlinear, 
regression-based, and learning-based have been 𝑚de𝑁veloped 
w𝑚e𝑁ll to achi𝑚ev𝑁e triaxial force sensing. Comparisons of results 
 
indicate that the model based on the cross-validation SVM
