Pinbot: A Walking Robot with Locking Pin Arrays for Passive 
Adaptability to Rough Terrains 
Seonghoon Noh, Student Member, IEEE and Aaron M. Dollar, Senior Member, IEEE 
d  Abstract‚Äî To date, many control strategies for legged robots 
have  been  proposed  for  stable  locomotion over  rough  and 
unstructured  terrains.  However,  these  approaches  require 
sensing information throughout locomotion, which may be noisy 
or unavailable at times. An alternative solution to rough terrain 
locomotion is a legged robot design that can passively adapt to 
the variations in the terrain without requiring knowledge of 
them. This paper presents one such solution in the design of a 
walking robot that employs pin array mechanisms to passively 
adapt to rough terrains. The pins are passively dropped over the 
terrain to conform to its variations and then locked to provide a 
statically stable stance. Locomotion is achieved with parallel 
four-bar  linkages  that  swing  forward  the  platforms  in  an 
alternating  manner.  Experimental  evaluation  of  the  robot 
demonstrates that the pin arrays enable legged locomotion over 
rough terrains under open-loop control.

pins, once they are released, so it requires an upward motion 
during the gait cycle to allow the pins to clear any obstacles in 
front of them. Therefore, a parallel four-bar linkage is used to 
join each of the two side pin arrays to the center pin array. The 
linkage rotates half a revolution and then stops to allow the 
side and center pin arrays to switch their gait phase, as shown 
in Figure 4. The parallel four-bar linkage was chosen for its 
simple design and actuation that can provide the cyclical 
motion needed for an alternating gait.

A.  Pin array mechanism 
We first evaluate the pin array‚Äôs locking mechanism and 
its implications on the stability of the robot. Because the 
diameter of the pinholes in the support and locking plates 
dictates whether the locking plate can contact every pin with 
a sufficient lateral force, numerous fabrication iterations (all 
using a laser cutter) were required to improve the uniformity 
of the locking force distribution while minimizing the friction 
on the pins during the release. Despite these iterations, only a 
portion of the pins could be locked. 
Figure 7 shows an image of a locked pin array after it was 
oriented upside down to allow the ineffectively locked pins to 
slide  out.  For  every  locked  pin  array,  there  often  were 
alternating rows of locked and unlocked pins, resulting in a 
higher average shear stress in the locked pins. This may be 
attributed to the arrangement pattern of the pins on the plates.
