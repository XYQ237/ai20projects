topology, the travel and wait times at rendezvous sites are
set to ensure following synchronization.
Similar to [21], we assume robots can only interact
intermittently, over very short time windows, and there is
no information sharing nor control action when robots are
outsidetheirdesignatedrendezvousneighborhoods.Different
from [21], the motions of the robots and the topology
of the resulting communication network is dictated by the
underlying geophysical ﬂuid dynamics where a bipartite
graph structure may not be achievable. Furthermore, the
active drifters may not have the necessary energy budget to
achieve robust station-keeping given the ambient dynamics.
