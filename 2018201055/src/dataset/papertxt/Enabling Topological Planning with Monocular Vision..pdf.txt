Safe high impedance control of a series-elastic
actuator with a disturbance observer
Kevin Haninger1, Abner Asignacion2, Sehoon Oh2
Abstract—In many series-elastic actuator applications, the
ability to safely render a wide range of impedance is important.
Advanced torque control techniques such as the disturbance
observer (DOB) can improve torque tracking performance, but
their impact on safe impedance range is not established. Here,
safetyisdeﬁnedwithloadportpassivity,andpassivityconditions
are developed for two variants of DOB torque control. These
conditions are used to determine the maximum safe stiffness
and Z-region of the DOB controllers, which are analyzed and
compared with the no DOB case. A feedforward controller is
proposedwhichincreasesthemaximumsafestiffnessoftheDOB
approaches. The results are experimentally validated by manual
excitation and in a high-stiffness environment.
