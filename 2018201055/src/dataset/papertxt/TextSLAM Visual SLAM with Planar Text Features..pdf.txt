Abstract—  Electrical  resistance  tomography  (ERT)  has 
previously been utilized to develop a large-scale tactile sensor 
because this approach enables the estimation of the conductivity 
distribution among the electrodes based on a known physical 
model. Such a sensor made with a stretchable material can 
conform to a curved surface. However, this sensor cannot fully 
cover a cylindrical surface because in such a configuration, the 
edges  of  the  sensor  must  meet  each  other.  The  electrode 
configuration becomes irregular in this edge region, which may 
degrade the sensor performance. In this paper, we introduce an 
ERT-based robotic skin with evenly and sparsely distributed 
electrodes. For implementation, we sprayed a carbon nanotube 
(CNT)-dispersed solution to form a conductive sensing domain 
on a cylindrical surface. The electrodes were firmly embedded in 
the surface so that the wires were not exposed to the outside. The 
sensor  output  images  were  estimated  using  a  deep  neural 
network (DNN), which was trained with noisy simulation data. 
An indentation experiment revealed that the localization error 
of  the  sensor  was  5.2  ±  3.3  mm,  which  is  remarkable 
performance with only 30 electrodes. A frame rate of up to 120 
Hz could be achieved with a sensing domain area of 𝟗𝟎 𝐜𝐦𝟐. The 
proposed  approach  simplifies  the  fabrication  of  3D-shaped 
sensors, allowing them to be easily applied to existing robot arms 
in a seamless and robust manner.

III.  SENSOR STRUCTURE AND FABRICATION 
  To implement a robust and reliable tactile sensor, it is 
necessary to simultaneously improve the sensor structure and 
fabrication process. The structure of the sensor is determined 
by  considering  the  sensor's  performance,  such  as  spatial 
resolution and sensitivity.  We also propose a fabrication 
method for establishing a stable sensing domain on large and 
curved  surface.  In  this  section,  the  sensor  structure  is 
introduced, including the shape of the sensor, the electrode 
configuration, the wiring, and the piezoresistive structure. 
Then, the fabrication process is explained step by step. 
A.  Sensor structure 
 An ERT-based tactile sensor can estimate external stimuli 
with only a few electrodes, but the sensor's performance varies 
with the placement of the electrodes. If the sensing region is 
far from the electrodes, the performance of the sensor will 
degrade due to the low current density, which is directly 
related to the sensitivity and spatial resolution. For example, 
the  center  region  of  the  sensor  will  show  poor  spatial 
resolution and sensitivity when electrodes are placed only on 
the boundary [9]. Therefore, we attempt to evenly distribute

C. Electronics of the ERT system 
To use an ERT-based sensor, it is necessary to perform 
current injection and measurement on the electrodes.  For 
efficient implementation, we have chosen to use a pairwise 
injection and measurement scheme [35]. The electrodes are 
connected to a multiplexer (ADG1206, Analog Devices, USA), 
which  is  controlled  by  a  DAQ  (myRIO-1900,  National 
Instruments, USA). The multiplexer is also connected to a 
current source and a voltage measurement channel to enable 
current injection and voltage measurement on the electrodes. 
The schematic of the ERT operating system is shown in Fig. 
5. Instead of using a constant current source, we use a constant 
voltage source and a serially connected reference resistor for 
compensation. In addition,  the  DAQ  has  an  FPGA  chip, 
enabling switching and measurement up to 120 kHz. Due to 
the fast sampling rate, the developed sensor also has a high
